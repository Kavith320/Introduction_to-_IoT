## ✅ Step-by-Step Setup

### 🟢 Step 1: Install Node.js (Required for Node-RED)

1. Visit: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the **LTS version** for your operating system
3. Run the installer:
   - Click "Next" on all steps
   - Accept terms and install with default settings
4. Finish the setup

### ✅ Step 2: Verify Node.js Installation

Open **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**, then run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
You should see versions like:

Copy
Edit
v18.18.0
9.5.0
🛠️ Step 3: Install Node-RED
Run this command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red
This installs Node-RED globally.

🚀 Step 4: Start Node-RED
In the terminal, type:

bash
Copy
Edit
node-red
You should see:

arduino
Copy
Edit
Server now running at http://127.0.0.1:1880/
🌐 Step 5: Open Node-RED in Browser
Open your browser

Go to: http://localhost:1880

This opens the Node-RED Flow Editor

✅ Step 6: Create Your First Test Flow
Drag an inject node from the left panel

Drag a debug node

Connect them with a wire

Click Deploy

Click the inject button to see output in the debug tab (right panel)

📌 Tips
Stop Node-RED with Ctrl + C in the terminal

Use npx node-red if node-red doesn’t start directly

To add MQTT or dashboard features, go to Menu → Manage Palette → Install
