# Introduction_to_IoT
This repository contains all the files and instructions for my university session on IoT using Node-RED, HiveMQ, and Wokwi (ESP32 simulator).  You will learn how to:  Create virtual IoT devices using Wokwi (no hardware needed!)  Send real-time data using MQTT to HiveMQ Cloud  Build dashboards and control devices using Node-RED

# IoT with Node-RED, Wokwi, and HiveMQ 🧠🌐

This repository contains materials and examples from a university session on building real-time IoT systems using Node-RED, HiveMQ, and the Wokwi ESP32 simulator.

## 📚 What’s Inside

- ✅ PDF Guide: Step-by-step setup instructions
- 🧪 Node-RED flow examples
- 🧰 Wokwi ESP32 simulator code
- 💻 MQTT simulation scripts

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install Node.js and Node-RED
2. Create a Wokwi project using the ESP32 example
3. Setup a free HiveMQ Cloud MQTT broker
4. Import the Node-RED flow
5. Start experimenting!
